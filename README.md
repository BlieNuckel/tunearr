<p align="center">
  A self-hosted web app for discovering, requesting, and managing music through Lidarr — with multi-user requests, taste-based recommendations, and optional Soulseek integration.

## Features

- **Discover** — Personalized recommendations built from your Plex listening history, plus new releases and genre exploration beyond your usual taste.
- **Search & browse** — Search MusicBrainz for artists and albums, then request them or add them straight to Lidarr.
- **Requests** — Multi-user request workflow with approvals, tracked until the music lands in your library.
- **Users & permissions** — Multiple accounts with granular permissions; each user can link their own Plex account.
- **Soulseek integration** — Hook up [slskd](https://github.com/slskd/slskd) and Lidarr downloads from Soulseek like from any normal indexer.
- **Buy or download** — Get suggestions for when an album is better bought than downloaded, with spending tracking and an optional budget.
- **Library** — Keep tabs on purchases, wanted albums, and requests, and follow artists to catch new releases.
- **Manual import** — Upload purchased music through the web interface and import it into Lidarr.

## Getting started

However you deploy (Docker or NixOS), first run works the same:

1. Open Tunearr in your browser (default port `3001`).
2. Create the first admin account.
3. Follow the onboarding wizard: connect Lidarr (URL + API key), pick quality/metadata profiles and a root folder, and optionally set up Last.fm, Plex, and the manual import directory.

Everything in the wizard can be changed later under **Settings**.

## Running with Docker Compose

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- A running Lidarr instance

### Setup

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  tunearr:
    image: ghcr.io/blienuckel/tunearr:latest
    user: "1000:1000"
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

If you want to use the manual import feature, also mount the directory your music files will be uploaded to:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./config:/config
  - /path/to/your/music/imports:/imports
```

2. Start the container:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

3. Open `http://localhost:3001` and follow [Getting started](#getting-started).

All persistent state (settings, database, logs) lives in the `/config` volume.

### Building from source

```sh
git clone git@github.com:BlieNuckel/tunearr.git
cd tunearr
docker build -t tunearr .
docker run -d -p 3001:3001 -v ./config:/config tunearr
```

## Running on NixOS

The repository is a flake that ships a package and a NixOS module.

1. Add the flake input:

```nix
{
  inputs.tunearr.url = "github:BlieNuckel/tunearr";
}
```

2. Import the module and enable the service:

```nix
{
  imports = [ inputs.tunearr.nixosModules.tunearr ];

  services.tunearr = {
    enable = true;
    port = 3001;
    openFirewall = true;
  };
}
```

3. Rebuild, open `http://<host>:3001`, and follow [Getting started](#getting-started).

### Module options

| Option                          | Default              | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `services.tunearr.enable`       | `false`              | Enable the service                                               |
| `services.tunearr.port`         | `3001`               | TCP port the server listens on                                   |
| `services.tunearr.dataDir`      | `"/var/lib/tunearr"` | Persistent state: SQLite database, config JSON, logs             |
| `services.tunearr.user`         | `"tunearr"`          | User to run as (set to an existing user, e.g. `media`, to share) |
| `services.tunearr.group`        | `"tunearr"`          | Group to run as                                                  |
| `services.tunearr.openFirewall` | `false`              | Open the port in the firewall                                    |
| `services.tunearr.environment`  | `{ }`                | Extra environment variables for the service                      |

An overlay is also available as `inputs.tunearr.overlays.default` if you prefer managing the package yourself.

## Integrations

| Service | Required | Purpose                                                      |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lidarr  | Yes      | Music library management; requests and imports go through it |
| Last.fm | No       | Similar artists and genre tags for discovery                 |
| Plex    | No       | Listening history and ratings that power recommendations     |
| slskd   | No       | Soulseek downloads via Lidarr (see below)                    |

MusicBrainz, Deezer (album artwork), and ListenBrainz are used automatically and need no configuration.

### Soulseek via slskd

Tunearr can bridge Soulseek into Lidarr's normal workflow. Point Tunearr at your slskd instance under **Settings → Integrations**, then add two things in Lidarr:

- An **indexer** of type Newznab pointing at `http(s)://<tunearr>/api/torznab`
- A **download client** of type SABnzbd pointing at `http(s)://<tunearr>/api/sabnzbd`

Lidarr then searches, grabs, and imports Soulseek releases exactly like it would from any indexer — Tunearr handles the translation to and from slskd behind the scenes.

> **Note:** the `/api/torznab` and `/api/sabnzbd` endpoints are unauthenticated so Lidarr can reach them. Don't expose Tunearr directly to the internet without a reverse proxy handling access control.

## Environment variables

| Variable         | Default    | Purpose                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `APP_CONFIG_DIR` | `./config` | Runtime config JSON, SQLite database, and logs |
| `PORT`           | `3001`     | Server port                                    |

## Development

You'll need Node.js 22 and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). If you use Nix, `nix develop` drops you into a shell with both.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server on port `3002` and the Express API on port `3001`; the client proxies `/api/*` to the server. Open `http://localhost:3002`.

Useful commands:

```sh
pnpm test          # frontend tests (Vitest + Testing Library)
pnpm test:server   # server tests
pnpm lint          # ESLint
pnpm typecheck     # TypeScript, client + server
pnpm dev:mock      # dev mode with a mocked Lidarr (MOCK_LIDARR=true)
```

The stack is React 19 + Tailwind CSS v4 on the frontend and Express 5 + SQLite (TypeORM) on the backend, all TypeScript. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for a full architecture overview.
